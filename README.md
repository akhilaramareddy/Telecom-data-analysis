# Telecom-data-analysis
The goal of this project was to explore telecom customer data and identify key issues affecting customer satisfaction, retention, and network efficiency. The insights were aimed at helping telecom operators make data-driven business decisions.

âœ… What I Did
Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand customer behavior, network usage patterns, and churn drivers.

Used histograms, box plots, and countplots to visualize the distribution and relationships across variables like monthly charges, contract types, and payment methods.

Applied Chi-square tests and ANOVA to validate statistical relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

Identified trends and problem areas, including high churn rates among month-to-month contract users and customers with high service charges.

Summarized findings with actionable recommendations to improve customer experience and optimize marketing strategies.
